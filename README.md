# Spiral Filling Tetrlogy (quadrilogy)

This is a small collection of C programs that suggests a solution to a bunch of leetcode problems which demends following the spiral order .


## Programs
### 1. Return elems in Spiral Order
It copies all the elements of a matrix into an array following the usual sprial order

### 2. Classic Spiral Fill
Fills the matrix starting from the top-left corner (0,0) and moves clockwise
